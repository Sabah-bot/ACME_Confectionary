# ACME Confectionary 

ACME Confectionary is a local confectionary company which sells directly out of its single store in Sheffield. Over the years, they’ve become popular amongst locals with many people returning time and again to buy their favourite products. Based on this popularity, the company has received some investment and, after completing a SWOT analysis they’re looking to launch a digital store with the aims of:

- Increasing customers
- Increasing their revenue
- Enabling returning customers to easily buy products regularly, over and over again

Below I have recommend digital technology solutions which would help them hit their above goals, focusing on features that would enable this.
